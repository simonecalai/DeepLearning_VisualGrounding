# DeepLearning_VisualGrounding

This project has been developed for the course "Deep Learning" held at the University of Trento, Italy. The CLIP model has been fine-tuned on the RefCOCOg dataset and integrated with YOLO, to predict a set of bounding boxes corresponding to the entities described in textual descriptions within a set of images.
